# Autocomplete-in-C
This is a project for my esc190 class in which I created a program that calculates the autocompletion for a word, by inputing an unfinished word, it will return the most probable word.

The program uses the wiktionary.txt file as a reference with values for each word, and a look up engine uses this to determine the corresponding word.
